#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

when the input value increases the run time also increases. and the rate almost equals to O(n)
 lets input = 1, while run one time, 
 when input = 2 while run two time 
 when input = 100 while run about 100 times

b)O(n^c)
 since it has two loops...the run time grow very fast when the input increases

c) O(c^n)
 recursive functions required very long time to run and increases with the input 

## Exercise II


e = 0
while e < f:
    e += 1
    f = n - e

Therefore I would say, the run time is O(n)==>when the n value increase the run time also increase but the brocken egges minimized
